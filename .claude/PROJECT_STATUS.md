  - heater-service-plans.md

### 2. Financing CTA Components
Created two custom financing components with LLM-optimized FAQ sections:

**Smart Display Logic** in `/src/pages/[service].astro`:
```javascript

const acElectricServices = ['hvac', 'air-conditioning', 'ac', 'heat-pump', 'cooling'];
```

### 3. Design System Overhaul

**Fixed Critical Color Mismatch**
- Changed from blue theme (#0066CC) to black/white branding (#000000)

## Technical Notes

### Dynamic Service Page Routing
File: `/src/pages/[service].astro`
- Uses `getStaticPaths()` to generate pages from markdown files
- Smart financing detection based on service keywords
- Dynamic service name extraction for personalized copy
- Schema markup for LocalBusiness, FAQ, and Breadcrumbs

### LLM Optimization Strategy
**For AI Search Visibility**:
- Structured Q&A format in financing sections
- Complete answers with specific details (phone numbers, terms, amounts)
- Proper HTML hierarchy (H1 > H2 > H3 > H4)
- Natural question phrasing (not "for LLMs" - learned that lesson!)
- Schema.org markup for rich results

### Design Principles Applied
1. **Conversion-Focused**: Clear CTAs, prominent phone numbers, trust badges
2. **Minimalist**: Black/white color scheme, generous whitespace
3. **Professional**: Bold typography, smooth animations, clean shadows
4. **Local SEO**: Structured data, location information, service area markup
5. **Mobile-First**: Responsive design with clamp() and proper breakpoints

## Key Learnings

1. **Write for humans, structure for machines** - Don't label content as "for LLMs", just use proper semantic HTML and structured data
2. **Trust indicators matter** - SJG badge placement was critical for credibility
3. **Design consistency** - Blue theme didn't match black/white brand identity
4. **Favicon specifics** - Square logos work better than stretched full logos
5. **Meta tag priorities** - Canonical URLs and Open Graph images are critical for SEO
