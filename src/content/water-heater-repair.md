## Common Water Heater Problems We Fix

### Fluctuating Water Temperature
Hot water goes cold during showers, or temperature varies unpredictably. Common causes include failing heating elements, sediment buildup, undersized unit, or thermostat problems.

### No Hot Water
Complete loss of hot water indicates serious problems like failed heating elements (electric), extinguished pilot light (gas), gas valve failure, or electrical issues.

### Low Hot Water Pressure
Reduced pressure at hot water fixtures only suggests sediment buildup in tank, corroded pipes, or failing pressure relief valve.

### Strange Noises
Rumbling, popping, or sizzling sounds often indicate sediment buildup causing overheating (tank models) or limescale deposits (tankless models).

### Leaking Tank
Water pooling around your water heater is a serious problem. Leaks can come from loose connections (repairable) or tank corrosion (requires replacement).

### Rusty or Unusual-Smelling Water
Discolored hot water indicates corroding anode rod or deteriorating tank. Sulfur smell suggests bacterial growth in tank.

### Longer Heating Time
Water takes much longer to heat than normal, indicating failing heating elements, sediment buildup, or capacity problems.

### Unexplained Energy Bill Increases
Rising energy costs without increased usage often signal declining water heater efficiency from sediment, failing components, or leaks.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How quickly can you respond to a water heater emergency?**
A: We provide 24/7 emergency water heater repair with average response times under 60 minutes in Cape May and Atlantic County. We prioritize urgent situations like complete loss of hot water or leaking units.

**Q: Should I repair or replace my water heater?**
A: If your water heater is under 8 years old and repair costs are reasonable (under $400-$500), repair is usually more economical. For units over 10 years old with major component failure, replacement often makes more financial sense. We provide honest assessments with cost comparisons.

**Q: Why is my water heater making rumbling noises?**
A: Rumbling or popping sounds typically indicate sediment buildup at the bottom of tank water heaters. As water heats beneath the sediment layer, it causes these noises. Professional flushing resolves the problem and improves efficiency.

**Q: How long do water heater repairs take?**
A: Most water heater repairs are completed within 1-2 hours. Simple fixes like thermostat or heating element replacement take 45-90 minutes, while complex diagnostics or multiple component repairs may take 2-3 hours.

**Q: What if my water heater is leaking?**
A: Turn off the power/gas supply and water inlet valve immediately, then call us. Small leaks from connections may be repairable, but leaks from the tank itself require water heater replacement. We provide emergency service to assess and address the situation quickly.

**Q: Do you repair tankless water heaters?**
A: Yes. Our technicians are trained to diagnose and repair all major tankless water heater brands including Navien, Rinnai, Noritz, and Takagi. Common tankless repairs include descaling, flame rod replacement, flow sensor service, and control board repairs.

**Q: How much does water heater repair cost?**
A: Repair costs range from $150-$1,200 depending on the problem and required parts. Simple repairs like thermostat replacement cost $150-$300, heating elements run $200-$400, while major component repairs like gas valve or control board replacement range $500-$1,200. We provide upfront pricing.

**Q: Can you repair water heaters on weekends or holidays?**
A: Absolutely. We provide 24/7 emergency water heater repair service every day of the year, including weekends and holidays. There are no extra charges for after-hours service.

Between professional maintenance visits:

### Monitor Your Water Heater
