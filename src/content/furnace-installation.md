## Furnace Installation Services

### Furnace Replacement
Is your existing furnace over 15-20 years old, requiring frequent repairs, or failing to heat your home efficiently? We provide complete furnace replacement services, removing your old system and installing a new, energy-efficient model tailored to your home's specific heating needs.

### New Construction Installation
Building a new home in Cape May or Atlantic County? We work with builders and homeowners to design and install heating systems for new construction projects. Our team coordinates with other trades and ensures your furnace is properly integrated with your home's infrastructure.

### Upgraded Furnace Installation
Upgrading from an older, inefficient furnace to a modern high-efficiency system? We help you select the ideal replacement that reduces energy costs while improving comfort. Today's furnaces can be up to 30% more efficient than models from just 10-15 years ago.

## Types of Furnaces We Install

### Gas Furnaces
The most common heating choice in New Jersey, natural gas furnaces provide reliable, cost-effective heating. Available in efficiency ratings from 80% AFUE (standard efficiency) to 98% AFUE (high efficiency/condensing models).

### Electric Furnaces
Ideal for homes without natural gas access or as supplemental heating. Electric furnaces are 100% efficient at the point of use and require less maintenance than gas models.

### Oil Furnaces
For properties using oil heating systems, we install modern, efficient oil furnaces that deliver consistent warmth and improved fuel economy compared to older models.

### Energy-Efficient Models
We specialize in high-efficiency furnaces with 95%+ AFUE ratings, variable-speed blowers, modulating burners, and smart thermostat compatibility for maximum comfort and minimum energy costs.

## Our Furnace Installation Process

### 1. Free In-Home Consultation
We visit your home to assess your current heating system, measure your space, evaluate insulation and ductwork, and discuss your comfort preferences and budget. This comprehensive evaluation ensures proper equipment selection.

### 2. Heat Load Calculation
Using Manual J calculations, we determine the exact heating capacity your home requires. Proper sizing is critical - oversized furnaces short-cycle and waste energy, while undersized units can't maintain comfort.

### 3. Equipment Selection & Quote
Based on our assessment, we recommend furnace options at different efficiency levels and price points. We explain the features, benefits, expected energy savings, and total installed cost for each option, helping you make an informed decision.

### 4. Professional Installation
Our certified installers remove your old equipment, install the new furnace according to manufacturer specifications, connect all electrical and gas/oil lines, integrate with existing ductwork, and ensure all safety controls function properly.

### 5. System Testing & Customer Training
After installation, we test the complete system through multiple heating cycles, verify proper airflow and combustion, calibrate the thermostat, and train you on operating your new furnace and thermostat features.

## Signs You Need Furnace Replacement

- **Rising Energy Bills** - Unexplained increases in heating costs signal declining efficiency
- **Unusual Noises** - Banging, popping, or screeching sounds from an aging furnace
- **Yellow Pilot Light** - Should be blue; yellow indicates potential carbon monoxide risk

## Energy Savings Calculator

Upgrading from an older furnace can save significantly on heating costs:

- **80% AFUE Furnace (15+ years old) → 95% AFUE High-Efficiency:**
  Annual savings: $400-$700 (based on 2,000 sq ft home, typical NJ winter)

- **70% AFUE Furnace (20+ years old) → 95% AFUE High-Efficiency:**
  Annual savings: $600-$1,000

These savings often offset the cost of a new furnace within 5-8 years, while improving comfort and reliability.

- Replace filters monthly during heating season

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How long does furnace installation take?**
A: Most residential furnace installations are completed within 1 to 2 days. Simple replacements in accessible locations may be finished in 6-8 hours, while new construction or complex installations requiring ductwork modifications may take 2-3 days.

**Q: When should I replace my furnace instead of repairing it?**
A: Replace if your furnace is over 15 years old with major component failure, repair costs exceed 50% of replacement value, or you're experiencing significantly higher energy bills. We provide honest assessments and repair vs. replacement cost comparisons.

**Q: What furnace efficiency level should I choose?**
A: For most homes in Cape May and Atlantic County, we recommend 95%+ AFUE high-efficiency furnaces. The higher upfront cost is offset by 15-25% lower heating costs annually. If budget is a primary concern, 90% AFUE mid-efficiency models offer good performance at lower initial investment.

**Q: Do you handle permits and inspections?**
A: Yes. We obtain all required local permits, coordinate inspections with local building departments, and ensure your installation meets all New Jersey building codes and manufacturer specifications.

**Q: Can I upgrade to a larger or smaller furnace?**
A: Furnace size should match your home's heat load calculation. Bigger isn't better - oversized furnaces short-cycle, reducing efficiency and lifespan. We perform professional load calculations to ensure proper sizing regardless of your old furnace's capacity.

**Q: What's the difference between single-stage, two-stage, and modulating furnaces?**
A: Single-stage runs at full capacity when heating. Two-stage operates at low capacity most of the time, ramping to high only when needed - more efficient and consistent. Modulating furnaces adjust output in small increments for ultimate comfort and efficiency. We help you choose based on your home and budget.

**Q: How much can I save with a high-efficiency furnace?**
A: Compared to a 15-year-old 80% AFUE furnace, a new 95% AFUE model typically saves $400-$700 annually on heating costs for an average 2,000 sq ft home in southern New Jersey. Savings increase with larger homes or older existing furnaces.

**Q: Do new furnaces require different maintenance?**
A: High-efficiency furnaces require the same basic maintenance as standard models - filter changes, annual professional tune-ups, and keeping vents clear. However, condensing furnaces (90%+ AFUE) have additional drain systems that should be checked annually.
