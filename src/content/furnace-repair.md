## Common Furnace Problems We Fix

### No Heat or Limited Heating

Temperature settings aren't responding correctly, or your furnace won't turn on when the thermostat calls for heat.

### Strange Noises or Odors
Banging, rattling, squealing, or unusual smells coming from your furnace indicate mechanical issues that need immediate attention.

### Pilot Light Issues
Gas furnaces with pilot light problems won't ignite properly, leaving you without heat.

Your furnace turns on and off repeatedly without completing full heating cycles, reducing efficiency and increasing wear.
