## Frequently Asked Questions

### How much does leak detection cost in Ocean City?

Leak detection in Ocean City typically costs $275-$750 depending on the complexity and technology required. Basic electronic leak detection starts around $275, while advanced services like thermal imaging or comprehensive slab leak detection range $400-$850. This investment often saves thousands by preventing extensive water damage and precisely locating leaks without unnecessary demolition.

### Can you find leaks without damaging my walls or floors?

Yes, our advanced leak detection technology is non-invasive. We use thermal imaging cameras, electronic leak detectors, and video pipe cameras to find leaks through walls and under floors without cutting or drilling. Only after precisely locating the leak do we make minimal, targeted access for repairs, saving you significant restoration costs.

### How do you detect slab leaks under concrete?

We use specialized electronic leak detection equipment and acoustic listening devices to pinpoint leaks in water lines beneath concrete slabs. By testing water pressure and using sensitive audio equipment, we can identify the exact location of under-slab leaks without breaking up your entire foundation, minimizing repair costs and disruption.

### Will my homeowners insurance cover leak detection?

Many Ocean City homeowners insurance policies cover leak detection when performed to locate the source of an existing problem causing damage. However, routine leak detection for preventive purposes is typically not covered. We provide detailed documentation and receipts for insurance claims. Check with your insurance provider about your specific coverage.

### How long does leak detection take?

Most leak detection services in Ocean City homes take 1-3 hours depending on the complexity and size of your property. Simple leak location might take an hour, while comprehensive whole-house leak detection with multiple technologies could take 3-4 hours. We'll provide a time estimate when you schedule your service.

### Can leak detection help lower my water bill?

Absolutely. Hidden leaks commonly waste 10,000-30,000 gallons per year in typical homes. Detecting and repairing these leaks can significantly reduce your Ocean City water and sewer bills. Many homeowners see $200-$500 annual savings after leak detection and repair, often recouping the detection cost in the first year.

### Do you offer leak detection for vacation homes in Ocean City?

Yes, we specialize in leak detection for Ocean City second homes and vacation properties. We can inspect properties before and after winter closure, investigate unexpected water bills while you're away, and provide peace of mind that your seasonal property isn't experiencing hidden leaks during the off-season.

### What happens if you can't find the leak?

While rare with our advanced technology, if we cannot definitively locate a leak, we don't charge for the detection service. Our 35 years of experience and state-of-the-art equipment mean we successfully find leaks in over 98% of cases. We'll also provide recommendations for monitoring and next steps.
