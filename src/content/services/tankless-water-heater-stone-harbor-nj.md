## Frequently Asked Questions

### How much does tankless water heater installation cost in Stone Harbor?

Stone Harbor tankless installations range from $3,500 to $6,500 for single units, depending on brand, capacity, and installation complexity. Dual-unit systems for large estates cost $7,000-$12,000. Price includes equipment, labor, permits, gas line upgrades (if needed), electrical work, venting, and warranty registration. We provide detailed quotes with no hidden costs.

### Will I need to upgrade my gas line for tankless?

Most tankless installations require gas line upgrades. Traditional tank heaters use 30,000-40,000 BTU; tankless units use 150,000-200,000 BTU, requiring 3/4" or 1" gas supply lines. We assess your existing gas service during consultation and include any necessary upgrades in your quote. Gas line upgrades are permitted and inspected as part of installation.

### How long does tankless water heater installation take?

Most Stone Harbor tankless installations complete in 6-10 hours over one day. Gas line upgrades add 2-4 hours. Permit processing requires 1-2 weeks before installation. Municipal inspection occurs 1-2 days after installation. Total timeline from consultation to completed project: 2-4 weeks depending on scheduling and permit processing.

### Can tankless water heaters handle Stone Harbor's hard water?

Yes, but hard water requires annual maintenance. Stone Harbor has moderately hard water with calcium and mineral content. We recommend annual flushing with descaling solution to prevent mineral buildup in heat exchangers. This simple maintenance ensures optimal performance and long lifespan. We offer annual service contracts for hassle-free maintenance.

### Are tankless water heaters good for vacation rental properties?

Excellent choice for Stone Harbor vacation rentals. Benefits include: endless hot water for high-occupancy weeks, energy savings during unoccupied periods (no standby loss), longer lifespan reduces replacement frequency, smaller size frees up storage space, and fewer guest complaints about running out of hot water. Many Stone Harbor property managers require tankless for premium rental properties.

### What happens if power goes out?

Tankless water heaters require electricity (120V) for ignition and controls, so they won't operate during power outages. Consider adding a small UPS (uninterruptible power supply) for basic operation during outages, or install a whole-home generator common in Stone Harbor estates. Traditional tank heaters with pilot lights work during outages but offer limited capacity.

### How do I maintain a tankless water heater?

Annual maintenance includes: flushing with descaling solution (takes 45-60 minutes), cleaning inlet filter screen (5 minutes, can DIY), inspecting venting connections, testing pressure relief valve, and checking gas connections. We offer annual maintenance service contracts. With proper maintenance, tankless units last 20+ years in Stone Harbor's coastal environment.

### Can you install tankless water heaters in historic Stone Harbor properties?

Absolutely. We have extensive experience installing tankless systems in Stone Harbor's historic homes. Tankless units often work better than traditional tanks in older properties due to compact size and flexible installation locations. We navigate historic district requirements and work with Stone Harbor building officials to ensure compliant installations that respect property character.
