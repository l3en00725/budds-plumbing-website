## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why do I need a plumbing inspection when buying an Avalon home?

Avalon homes, especially luxury shore properties, have complex plumbing systems and face coastal corrosion challenges. A plumbing inspection reveals hidden problems like old water heaters, corroded pipes, sewer line issues, and outdated systems that general home inspectors might miss. This protects Avalon home buyers from surprise expenses and provides negotiating leverage. Many buyers save thousands by identifying problems before closing.

### What's included in a pre-purchase plumbing inspection for Avalon homes?

Our Avalon pre-purchase inspection includes testing all fixtures, water pressure evaluation, water heater assessment, visible pipe inspection, drain flow testing, gas line check (if applicable), outdoor plumbing review, and detailed written report with photos and repair cost estimates. Optional sewer camera inspection provides complete picture. Typical inspection takes 2-4 hours depending on Avalon home size.

### How much does a plumbing inspection cost in Avalon?

Avalon plumbing inspections range from $245-$395 for annual preventive checks, $295-$445 for seasonal inspections, and $395-$1,495 for pre-purchase inspections depending on home size. Sewer camera inspection adds $295. These costs are minor compared to surprise repairs that inspections help Avalon homeowners avoid. Most buyers and sellers find inspection cost pays for itself many times over.

### When should Avalon homeowners schedule plumbing inspections?

Annual inspections are recommended for all Avalon homeowners. Second-home owners should inspect during spring opening and fall closing. Schedule pre-purchase inspections during your buying due diligence period. Pre-sale inspections should occur 2-3 months before listing to allow time for repairs. Avalon rental property owners should inspect before each rental season.

### Can you inspect while I'm not in Avalon?

Yes, many Avalon second-home owners coordinate inspections while away. We can work with property managers, real estate agents, or key holders to access your Avalon home. We'll provide detailed written reports with photos and schedule a phone consultation to review findings. This gives Avalon homeowners peace of mind about their property even when not in residence.

### What if your inspection finds major problems in my Avalon home?

Our detailed report prioritizes issues (urgent, recommended, minor) and provides repair cost estimates. For home buyers, this information helps negotiate repairs or price adjustments. For sellers, you can address issues before listing or price accordingly. For homeowners, you can budget and plan repairs strategically. We provide estimates but never pressure Avalon homeowners to use our repair services.

### Do you provide inspection reports for real estate transactions?

Yes, our professional inspection reports are accepted by real estate agents, attorneys, and mortgage lenders throughout Avalon. Reports include detailed findings, color photos, repair estimates, and professional recommendations. We can coordinate timing with home inspection contingencies and provide additional documentation if needed for Avalon real estate transactions.

### How long does a plumbing inspection take in Avalon?

Standard Avalon home inspections take 2-3 hours. Larger luxury properties may take 3-4 hours for thorough evaluation. Seasonal inspections typically take 1-2 hours. Sewer camera inspection adds 1 hour. We work efficiently while being thorough, and provide detailed reports within 24-48 hours after inspecting your Avalon property.
