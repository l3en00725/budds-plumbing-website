## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I know what size water heater I need for my Avalon home?

Size depends on household occupancy and fixture count. For Avalon shore homes, we typically recommend: 1-2 people (40-50 gallon tank or small tankless), 3-4 people (65-75 gallon or mid-size tankless), 5+ people (80+ gallon or large tankless/dual systems). We perform detailed usage analysis during consultation to ensure proper sizing.

### Are tankless water heaters worth the investment in Avalon?

Yes, especially for larger shore properties. Tankless systems provide endless hot water for multiple bathrooms and outdoor showers, save 20-30% on energy costs, last 20+ years vs. 10-12 for tanks, and take minimal space. Most Avalon homeowners recoup the higher upfront cost through energy savings and increased property value.

### How long does water heater installation take in Avalon?

Most installations complete in 4-8 hours, with traditional tank replacements on the shorter end and tankless installations requiring more time. Permit processing adds 1-2 days before installation. We schedule around your availability and rental commitments when possible.

### What's the average cost of water heater installation in Avalon?

Avalon installations range from $1,800 for basic 40-gallon tank replacements to $7,000+ for premium tankless systems. Factors include unit type, capacity, fuel source, venting requirements, and any necessary upgrades to gas lines or electrical service. All quotes include permits, labor, and materials.

### Do I need permits for water heater installation in Avalon?

Yes, Avalon requires building permits for all water heater installations. We handle all permit applications and coordinate required inspections as part of our service. This ensures code compliance and protects your property value and insurance coverage.

### Can you install water heaters in coastal Avalon properties?

Absolutely. We specialize in coastal installations using corrosion-resistant materials and proper venting designed for salt air environments. All components are selected specifically for shore property durability, and we follow enhanced corrosion protection protocols.

### What maintenance do water heaters need in Avalon?

Annual maintenance includes: flushing sediment (especially important with hard shore water), testing pressure relief valve, checking anode rod (tank models), descaling heat exchanger (tankless), and inspecting gas connections. We offer maintenance plans specifically designed for Avalon's coastal conditions.

### What warranty coverage do you provide?

We provide a 1-year labor warranty on all installations and honor full manufacturer warranties (typically 6-12 years on tanks, 12-15 years on tankless heat exchangers). Licensed, insured installation ensures warranty validity and your peace of mind.
