## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What are the main benefits of the Heater Service Plan?**
A: The main benefits include significant cost savings ($200-$800 annually), priority scheduling ahead of non-members, regular preventative maintenance that prevents breakdowns, access to certified expert technicians, 24/7 emergency support (Gold members), and peace of mind knowing your heating systems are professionally maintained.

**Q: How much does the plan cost?**
A: We offer two tiers: Silver Package at $12/month + tax ($144/year) and Gold Package at $36/month + tax ($432/year). Cost varies depending on your heating system type and specific needs. Most homeowners find the Gold Package pays for itself within 1-2 service calls.

**Q: Can I cancel my service plan?**
A: Yes. Our plans have no long-term contracts or cancellation fees. You can cancel anytime with 30 days notice. However, most members find the benefits far exceed the cost and remain enrolled for years.

**Q: Do I have to use Budd's Plumbing exclusively?**
A: While you can call other companies, you'll lose the benefits of membership including priority service, discounts, and included maintenance. Our service plan provides the best value when you use us for all your heating and plumbing needs.

**Q: What if I have multiple heating systems?**
A: We offer multi-system discounts. If you have multiple furnaces, water heaters, or properties, contact us for custom pricing. Many members with vacation homes or rental properties save significantly.

**Q: Is maintenance really necessary if my system seems fine?**
A: Absolutely. Most heating failures happen without warning. Annual maintenance identifies small issues before they become expensive emergencies, maintains efficiency to reduce energy costs, extends equipment lifespan, and ensures safety. It's the single best investment in your heating system.

**Q: What happens if I need emergency service?**
A: Members call our 24/7 emergency line and receive priority response. Gold members pay zero service fees, while Silver members pay standard service fees but still receive priority scheduling ahead of non-members.

**Q: Do service plans cover repairs?**
A: Plans include preventative maintenance, not repairs. However, members receive 5% discounts on all repair work and no service fees (Gold members). The regular maintenance dramatically reduces the likelihood of repairs.
