## Our Sewer Line Services

### Video Pipe Inspections
Before recommending solutions, we use advanced video camera technology to inspect your sewer line interior. This allows us to:

- Identify exact location and nature of problems
- Assess pipe condition throughout the system
- Detect tree root intrusions, cracks, or collapses
- Locate the main sewer line path
- Provide visual evidence for insurance claims
- Recommend the most effective repair approach

**Inspection Cost:** $250-$400

### Trenchless Sewer Line Repair
Modern trenchless techniques repair sewer lines with minimal excavation:

**Pipe Lining (CIPP - Cured-In-Place Pipe):**
- Insert resin-coated liner into existing pipe
- Cure in place to form new pipe within old pipe
- Minimal excavation (only access points)
- Restores structural integrity
- 50+ year lifespan
- Cost: $3,500-$8,000 depending on length

**Pipe Bursting:**
- Pull new pipe through old pipe while breaking apart old pipe
- Suitable for severely damaged pipes
- Minimal digging (access points only)
- Can upsize pipe diameter
- Cost: $5,000-$12,000 depending on length and diameter

### Traditional Excavation Repair
When trenchless methods aren't suitable, we perform traditional excavation repair:

- Precise excavation of affected areas
- Removal of damaged pipe sections
- Installation of new pipe
- Proper bedding and backfill
- Restoration of landscaping
- Cost: $3,000-$10,000 depending on depth and length

## Signs You Need Sewer Line Repair

### Persistent Clogs
Multiple drains clogging frequently, especially lower-level fixtures, indicates main sewer line blockage.

### Bad Odors
Sewer gas smells around your home, yard, or from drains suggests sewer line cracks or blockages.

### Water Pooling in Yard
Soggy spots or standing water in your yard, especially near the sewer line path, indicates breaks or leaks.

### Slow Drainage
All drains in your home draining slowly simultaneously points to main sewer line problems, not individual fixture issues.

### Sewage Backups
Sewage backing up into toilets, tubs, or floor drains is a serious problem requiring immediate attention.

### Unusually Green Grass
A patch of exceptionally green, fast-growing grass over your sewer line indicates sewage leaking and fertilizing the area.

### Foundation Cracks or Settlement
Sewer leaks can wash away soil beneath foundations, causing cracks, settlement, or sinkholes.

### Increased Pest Activity
Rats, insects, and other pests are attracted to broken sewer lines and may enter your home through cracks.

## Common Causes of Sewer Line Damage

### Tree Root Intrusions
Tree roots seek moisture and nutrients in sewer lines, penetrating through joints and cracks. Once inside, roots grow rapidly, causing blockages and eventual pipe damage.

### Pipe Corrosion
Older metal sewer pipes corrode over time from internal chemical reactions and external soil conditions. Corrosion creates rough surfaces (causing clogs) and eventually holes (causing leaks).

### Ground Shifting
Soil settlement, frost heaving, earthquakes, or nearby construction can shift and break rigid sewer pipes, especially older clay or cast iron lines.

### Heavy Clogs
Years of grease, hair, "flushable" wipes, and other debris can create massive clogs that traditional drain cleaning can't resolve.

### Improper Pipe Installation
Poorly installed sewer lines with inadequate slope, improper materials, or faulty connections eventually fail, sometimes decades after installation.

### Age and Deterioration
Sewer pipes have finite lifespans. Clay pipes (50-60 years), cast iron (50-75 years), and early PVC installations may reach end-of-life and require replacement.

## Our Sewer Line Repair Process

### 1. Diagnostic Inspection
We begin with video camera inspection to identify the exact problem location, assess overall pipe condition, determine the best repair approach, and provide visual documentation.

### 2. Problem Identification
Our technicians explain findings clearly, show you the video footage, discuss repair options, and provide upfront pricing for each approach.

### 3. Tailored Repair/Replacement Solution
Based on pipe condition, damage location, budget considerations, and property landscaping, we recommend the most effective solution.

### 4. Minimally Invasive Techniques
We use trenchless methods when possible to preserve landscaping, reduce costs, complete work faster, and minimize disruption.

### 5. Efficient Restoration
After repairs, we test the system thoroughly, ensure proper drainage, restore excavated areas, clean the work site completely, and provide warranty documentation.

### Root Barrier Treatment
Chemical root treatments every 1-2 years can prevent tree roots from entering sewer lines.

### Proper Disposal Practices
Never flush grease, "flushable" wipes, feminine products, paper towels, or other debris that can contribute to clogs.

### Professional Drain Cleaning
Annual professional drain cleaning removes buildup before it becomes a major blockage.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How do I know if I need sewer line repair?**
A: Warning signs include multiple drains clogging or draining slowly, sewage backups, bad odors near drains or in your yard, water pooling in yard, and gurgling sounds from drains. If you notice these issues, call for video inspection to diagnose the problem.

**Q: How much does sewer line repair cost?**
A: Costs vary widely based on problem severity and repair method. Video inspection runs $250-$400, spot repairs cost $1,500-$3,500, trenchless pipe lining runs $3,500-$8,000, and full replacement ranges $5,000-$15,000. We provide detailed estimates after inspection.

**Q: What is trenchless sewer repair?**
A: Trenchless repair uses advanced techniques to repair sewer lines without digging up your entire yard. Methods include pipe lining (inserting a new pipe within the old pipe) and pipe bursting (pulling new pipe through while breaking old pipe). These methods save landscaping and reduce costs.

**Q: How long does sewer line repair take?**
A: Timeline depends on repair type and extent. Video inspection takes 1-2 hours, spot repairs can be completed in 1-2 days, trenchless lining takes 1-3 days, and full excavation replacement may take 3-7 days including restoration.

**Q: Will you restore my yard after excavation?**
A: Yes. We restore all excavated areas including backfilling, grading, reseeding or sodding, and replacing pavers or concrete. Restoration is included in our estimates.

**Q: Can tree roots damage my sewer line?**
A: Absolutely. Tree roots are one of the most common causes of sewer line damage. Roots grow toward moisture and nutrients in sewer pipes, penetrating through joints and cracks. Once inside, they expand rapidly, causing blockages and pipe damage.

**Q: Is sewer line repair covered by homeowners insurance?**
A: Coverage varies by policy and cause of damage. Sudden, accidental damage is more likely to be covered than gradual deterioration. We provide video inspection documentation and detailed reports to support insurance claims. Check with your insurance provider.

**Q: How can I prevent sewer line problems?**
A: Key prevention steps include scheduling video inspections every 3-5 years, avoiding flushing grease and non-biodegradable items, using root barrier treatments if you have large trees, addressing small drain problems promptly, and scheduling annual professional drain cleaning.
