### Heat Pump Water Heaters

**Considerations:**

## When to Replace Your Water Heater

### Age
Tank water heaters last 8-12 years, tankless models 20+ years. If your tank water heater is over 10 years old, replacement is usually more economical than repair.

### Frequent Repairs
If you're calling for repairs annually, or repair costs exceed $500, replacement typically makes more financial sense.

### Declining Performance
Insufficient hot water, temperature fluctuations, or longer recovery times indicate declining capacity.

### Rust or Corrosion
Visible rust on tank exterior or rusty water from hot taps indicates tank corrosion requiring replacement.

### Leaking
Water pooling around your water heater often indicates tank failure requiring immediate replacement.

### Rising Energy Bills
Unexplained increases in utility costs suggest declining efficiency that replacement can resolve.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How long does water heater replacement take?**
A: Most residential water heater replacements are completed within 3-5 hours. Tank-to-tank replacements in accessible locations take 3-4 hours, while tankless installations or complex situations requiring additional work may take 4-6 hours.

A: Yes. New Jersey requires permits for water heater replacement to ensure code compliance and safety. We handle all permitting and inspections as part of our installation service.

A: Water heater sizing depends on household size, hot water usage patterns, simultaneous fixture use, and space constraints. As a general guide: 2-3 people need 40-50 gallons, 3-4 people need 50-60 gallons, and 5+ people need 60-80 gallons or tankless.

**Q: How much can I save with an energy-efficient water heater?**
A: Energy savings vary based on your current water heater age and type. Typical savings: upgrading from a 10-15 year old tank to new efficient tank saves $50-$100 annually, upgrading to tankless saves $100-$200 annually, and upgrading to heat pump electric saves $200-$400 annually.
