## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Should I repair or replace my water heater?**
A: If your water heater is under 8 years old and repair costs are under $400-$500, repair is usually more economical. For units over 10 years old with major problems, replacement typically makes more financial sense. We provide honest assessments with cost comparisons.

**Q: How long does installation take?**
A: Most water heater replacements are completed within 3-5 hours. Tank-to-tank replacements take 3-4 hours, while tankless installations may require 4-6 hours depending on necessary modifications.

**Q: What size water heater do I need?**
A: Sizing depends on household size and usage patterns. General guidelines: 2-3 people need 40-50 gallons, 3-4 people need 50-60 gallons, 5+ people need 60-80 gallons or tankless. We perform detailed assessments for accurate recommendations.

**Q: Are tankless water heaters worth it?**
A: For most families, yes. While tankless costs more upfront ($2,500-$4,500 vs. $800-$2,200 for tanks), they provide unlimited hot water, last 20+ years (vs. 10-12), use 20-30% less energy, and save $100-$200 annually. Payback period is typically 8-12 years.

**Q: Do you offer same-day service?**
A: Yes. For repairs, we provide same-day emergency service 24/7. For installations, same-day service is often available depending on product availability and schedule. Call for current availability.

**Q: What if my water heater is leaking?**
A: Turn off the power (circuit breaker for electric, gas valve for gas) and water supply immediately, then call us. Small leaks from connections may be repairable, but tank leaks require replacement. We provide emergency service to minimize water damage.

**Q: Do you handle permits and inspections?**
A: Yes. We obtain all required local permits and coordinate inspections with your municipal building department, ensuring full code compliance at no extra charge.

**Q: What's the warranty on new water heaters?**
A: Manufacturer warranties typically include 6-12 years on tanks, 3-5 years on parts, and 1 year on labor. We also warranty our installation work for 90 days. Extended warranties available.
