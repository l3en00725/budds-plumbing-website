## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What is a sump pump?**
A: A sump pump is a device installed in a pit (sump) in your basement that automatically pumps out water when it reaches a certain level, preventing flooding by directing water away from your home's foundation.

**Q: How do I know if I need a sump pump?**
A: You need a sump pump if your basement floods or experiences dampness during storms, your home is in a low-lying area with poor drainage, you have a high water table, or you notice water intrusion signs like stains, musty odors, or efflorescence.

**Q: How long does sump pump installation take?**
A: Basic sump pump installation typically takes 3-4 hours. Systems requiring outdoor discharge line burial, battery backup installation, or complex modifications may take 4-6 hours or spread over 1-2 days.

**Q: Do I need a battery backup sump pump?**
A: Battery backup is highly recommended if you're in a flood-prone area, experience frequent power outages, have a finished basement with valuables, or want maximum protection. Storms causing flooding often cause power outages, rendering standard pumps useless.

**Q: How often should I replace my sump pump?**
A: Replace sump pumps every 7-10 years. Even quality pumps wear out from continuous use. Proactive replacement prevents unexpected failures during storms.

**Q: How much does sump pump installation cost?**
A: Basic installation ranges $800-$1,500 including pump, pit, discharge piping, and labor. Adding battery backup increases cost to $1,500-$2,500. Complex installations requiring extensive discharge line work may cost $2,000-$4,000.

**Q: Where does the water go?**
A: Sump pumps discharge water through piping that runs outside your home, typically 10-20 feet away from the foundation into your yard, storm drain system (if permitted), or dry well.

**Q: Can I install a sump pump myself?**
A: While possible, professional installation ensures proper pit depth, correct pump sizing, proper discharge routing, code compliance, and reliable operation. Improper installation can lead to pump failure when you need it most.
