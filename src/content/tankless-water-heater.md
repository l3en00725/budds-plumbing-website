WHAT IS A TANKLESS WATER HEATER AND HOW DOES IT WORK?
When it comes to home upgrades, installing a tankless water heater is one of the smartest decisions you can make. These modern, energy-efficient systems have gained immense popularity among homeowners for their impressive benefits and innovative design. If you're considering upgrading or simply curious about what makes tankless water heaters such a great option, this guide will cover everything you need to know.
WHY SWITCH TO A TANKLESS WATER HEATER?
Unlike traditional water heaters that store hot water in a tank, tankless water heaters provide hot water on demand. When you turn on the hot water tap, cold water flows through the unit where it is rapidly heated by either an electric element or a gas burner. This means you’ll never run out of hot water, no matter how long your shower lasts or how many appliances are running.

Because there’s no need for a storage tank, these systems are also called on-demand water heaters. They only work when hot water is needed, making them much more efficient than their traditional counterparts.
THE BENEFITS OF GOING TANKLESS
If you're weighing your options between a traditional water heater and a tankless model, here are some compelling reasons why tankless water heaters are worth considering:
1. Endless Hot Water
One of the biggest perks is enjoying a continuous supply of hot water whenever you need it. With no tank that can "empty," you’re never left waiting for the water to heat back up after a shower or laundry load.
2. Energy Efficiency
Traditional water heaters constantly heat water, even when you’re not using it. This "standby heat loss" is wasteful and drives up your energy bills. Tankless water heaters eliminate this issue by heating water only when needed, significantly reducing energy consumption. According to studies, you can save around 25-35% on energy costs with a tankless system.
3. Space-Saving Design
Say goodbye to the bulky tanks that take up storage or utility room space. Tankless water heaters are compact and can often be wall-mounted, freeing up valuable square footage in your home.
4. Longer Lifespan
With proper care, tankless water heaters last significantly longer than traditional models. While a conventional water heater might last 8-12 years, a tankless water heater can easily perform well for 20 years or more.
5. Lower Utility Bills
Over time, the energy savings from using a tankless system can make a noticeable difference in your monthly bills. Though the upfront cost might be higher, the long-term savings easily justify the investment.
MAINTENANCE TIPS FOR OPTIMAL PERFORMANCE
To keep your tankless water heater performing at its best, regular maintenance is key. Here are a few tips to ensure long-lasting reliability:
DESCALE REGULARLY
Hard water can leave mineral deposits that affect efficiency. Descaling the unit, ideally, once a year, prevents buildup.
CLEAN FILTERS
The water filter within the unit should be routinely cleaned to maintain proper flow and filtration.
FLUSH THE SYSTEM
If you live in an area with hard water, flushing the heater prevents sediment buildup in the lines.
CHECK VENTS AND CONNECTIONS
For gas-powered models, inspect vents and connections for blockages or leaks.
SCHEDULE PROFESSIONAL SERVICE
Annual checkups by a licensed plumber can catch any issues early and ensure your system is running smoothly.
IS A TANKLESS WATER HEATER RIGHT FOR YOU?
Upgrading to a tankless water heater is a decision that offers long-term benefits in energy efficiency, convenience, and savings. Whether you’re aiming to reduce your energy bills, need a space-saving solution, or simply want to experience the comfort of endless hot water, a tankless system is worth the consideration.

Budd’s Plumbing is committed to helping homeowners in Atlantic County make informed decisions about their plumbing needs. Our skilled team of plumbers provides expert consultations, seamless installations, and reliable maintenance services for tankless water heaters.
