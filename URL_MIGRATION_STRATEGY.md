# URL Migration Strategy - Budds Plumbing Website
## Webflow to Astro Migration Plan

**Date:** October 13, 2025
**Status:** Strategic Planning Phase
**Risk Level:** Medium (SEO Impact Potential)
**Mitigation:** Comprehensive 301 Redirect Strategy

---

## 1. URL Structure Analysis

### Current Webflow Site Structure (buddsplumbing.com)

#### Root-Level Service Pages (High Authority)
These pages likely have established Google rankings and backlinks:
- `/tankless-water-heater`
- `/drain-cleaning`
- `/toilet-repair`
- `/faucet-repair`
- `/sink-installation-and-repair`
- `/garbage-disposal`
- `/sump-pump-installation`
- `/sewer-line-repair-replacement`
- `/boiler-repair-installation`
- `/water-heater-repair`

#### /services/ Subdirectory Pages
- `/services/piping-repiping`
- `/services/tankless-water-heaters`
- `/services/gas-line-plumbing`
- `/services/plumbing-maintenance`
- `/services/showers-bathtubs`
- `/services/toilets`

### New Astro Site Structure

#### New Location-Specific Service Pages (Under /services/)
These are NEW pages that don't exist on Webflow - **No SEO penalty risk**:
- `/services/emergency-plumber-cape-may-county`
- `/services/emergency-plumber-ocean-city-nj`
- `/services/emergency-plumber-wildwood-nj`
- `/services/emergency-plumber-atlantic-city-nj`
- `/services/emergency-plumber-egg-harbor-township`
- `/services/emergency-plumber-vineland-nj`
- `/services/emergency-plumber-millville-nj`
- `/services/bathroom-renovation-stone-harbor-nj`
- `/services/water-heater-installation-avalon-nj`
- `/services/drain-cleaning-ocean-city-nj`
- `/services/tankless-water-heater-stone-harbor-nj`
- `/services/plumbing-repair-ocean-city-nj`
- `/services/leak-detection-ocean-city-nj`
- `/services/sewer-line-repair-cape-may-nj`
- `/services/pipe-repair-ocean-city-nj`
- `/services/plumbing-inspection-avalon-nj`
- `/services/water-line-repair-stone-harbor-nj`

#### Migrated General Service Pages (Currently in /src/content/)
These exist on Webflow and need careful URL mapping:
- `/src/content/tankless-water-heater.md` (originalUrl: /tankless-water-heater)
- `/src/content/drain-cleaning.md` (originalUrl: /drain-cleaning)

---

## 2. Migration Strategy - SEO Protection Plan

### ✅ RECOMMENDED APPROACH: Maintain Existing URL Authority

**Strategy:** Keep all existing Webflow URLs EXACTLY as-is to preserve Google rankings.

#### Phase 1: General Service Pages (Preserve Root URLs)
For established pages like `/tankless-water-heater` and `/drain-cleaning`:

**KEEP EXISTING ROOT-LEVEL URLS:**
- `/tankless-water-heater` → Keep at root level
- `/drain-cleaning` → Keep at root level
- `/toilet-repair` → Keep at root level
- `/faucet-repair` → Keep at root level
- All other root-level service pages → Keep at root level

**ALSO ADD /services/ SUBDIRECTORY STRUCTURE:**
- `/services/piping-repiping` → Keep at /services/
- `/services/tankless-water-heaters` → Keep at /services/
- `/services/gas-line-plumbing` → Keep at /services/

#### Phase 2: Location-Specific Pages (New Content Strategy)
These are NEW pages - no SEO penalty risk since they don't exist on Webflow:
- All location-specific pages stay under `/services/[service]-[location]`
- No redirects needed (brand new content)
- Creates a clear content hierarchy:
  - **General pages at root:** `/drain-cleaning` (county-wide service)
  - **Location-specific under /services/:** `/services/drain-cleaning-ocean-city-nj` (city-specific)

---

## 3. Dual URL Strategy - Best of Both Worlds

### The Problem
You have TWO types of content:
1. **General service pages** (root level on Webflow): `/tankless-water-heater`
2. **Location-specific pages** (new content): `/services/tankless-water-heater-stone-harbor-nj`

### The Solution: Strategic Content Architecture

#### ✅ Keep BOTH URL Structures (Recommended)

**General Service Pages (Root Level) - County-Wide:**
- `/tankless-water-heater` - Overview of tankless water heater services for entire service area
- `/drain-cleaning` - General drain cleaning for Cape May, Atlantic, Cumberland Counties
- `/toilet-repair` - General toilet repair services
- **Purpose:** Broad keyword targeting, established rankings, county-wide focus
- **Target Keywords:** "tankless water heater NJ", "drain cleaning Cape May County"

**Location-Specific Service Pages (/services/) - City-Level:**
- `/services/tankless-water-heater-stone-harbor-nj` - Luxury market focus
- `/services/drain-cleaning-ocean-city-nj` - Tourism/vacation rental focus
- `/services/emergency-plumber-ocean-city-nj` - Hyper-local emergency services
- **Purpose:** Hyper-local targeting, city-specific optimization, long-tail keywords
- **Target Keywords:** "emergency plumber Ocean City NJ", "Stone Harbor bathroom renovation"

#### Content Differentiation Strategy
**General Pages Focus:**
- Broad service descriptions
- County-wide coverage
- Service process and benefits
- General pricing guidance
- Company credentials

**Location-Specific Pages Focus:**
- City-specific content (landmarks, neighborhoods)
- Market-specific messaging (tourism, luxury, residential)
- Local authority signals (response times, local experience)
- City-specific FAQs
- Neighborhood testimonials

#### Internal Linking Strategy
**From General to Specific:**
```markdown
<!-- On /tankless-water-heater page -->
Looking for tankless water heater service in specific areas?
- [Tankless Water Heater Stone Harbor](/services/tankless-water-heater-stone-harbor-nj)
- [Water Heater Installation Avalon](/services/water-heater-installation-avalon-nj)
```

**From Specific to General:**
```markdown
<!-- On /services/tankless-water-heater-stone-harbor-nj page -->
Learn more about our [general tankless water heater services](/tankless-water-heater)
throughout Cape May County.
```

## 4. 301 Redirect Implementation Plan

### When to Use 301 Redirects

**✅ REQUIRED 301 Redirects:**
1. **URL structure changes** from Webflow to Astro
2. **Consolidated pages** (if merging multiple Webflow pages)
3. **Renamed pages** (if URLs must change)

**❌ NO 301 Redirects Needed:**
1. **New location-specific pages** (don't exist on Webflow)
2. **Exact URL matches** (if Astro URLs match Webflow URLs)

### Redirect Map (If URLs Change)

Based on current migration status:

#### Scenario A: If Keeping Root-Level URLs (RECOMMENDED)
**NO REDIRECTS NEEDED** - URLs remain identical:
- `/tankless-water-heater` → `/tankless-water-heater` (Same URL)
- `/drain-cleaning` → `/drain-cleaning` (Same URL)

#### Scenario B: If Moving to /services/ (NOT RECOMMENDED)
**301 Redirects Required:**
```
/tankless-water-heater → /services/tankless-water-heater
/drain-cleaning → /services/drain-cleaning
/toilet-repair → /services/toilet-repair
[etc. for all root-level service pages]
```

### Implementation Method: Vercel Configuration

Since your Astro site will likely deploy to Vercel, create a `vercel.json` file:

```json
{
  "redirects": [
    {
      "source": "/old-url-path",
      "destination": "/new-url-path",
      "permanent": true
    }
  ]
}
```

**Note:** Only implement redirects if you MUST change URLs. Otherwise, keep URLs identical.

## 6. Service Page Strategy Validation

### Review of SERVICE_PAGES_STRATEGY.md

**✅ Strengths:**
1. **Clear Tier Structure** - Emergency (Tier 1), High-Value (Tier 2), Seasonal (Tier 3)
2. **Location Segmentation** - Cape May (tourism), Atlantic (commercial), Cumberland (residential)
3. **Market-Specific Messaging** - Tailored content for each demographic
4. **FAQ-Driven Content** - Optimized for AI Overviews and featured snippets

**✅ SEO Alignment:**
1. **Long-Tail Keywords** - "emergency plumber Ocean City NJ" (highly specific)
2. **Geographic Targeting** - City-level optimization for local search
3. **Commercial Intent** - Emergency services target high-intent buyers
4. **Schema Implementation** - Service, LocalBusiness, FAQPage schemas

**⚠️ Considerations:**
1. **URL Structure** - Strategy document doesn't specify root vs. /services/ structure
2. **Content Overlap Risk** - Ensure general pages and location-specific pages differentiate clearly
3. **Cannibalization Prevention** - Internal linking must guide users from general → specific

### Strategic Recommendation: Hybrid Model

**General Pages (Root Level) = Broad Match:**
- `/drain-cleaning` - Targets "drain cleaning Cape May County"
- Serves users researching service options
- Links to location-specific pages for conversion

**Location Pages (/services/) = Exact Match:**
- `/services/drain-cleaning-ocean-city-nj` - Targets "drain cleaning Ocean City"
- Serves users ready to book in specific location
- Converts high-intent local searchers

**SEO Benefit:**
- Captures BOTH broad and long-tail searches
- Avoids cannibalization through content differentiation
- Establishes topical authority (general page) + local authority (location pages)
