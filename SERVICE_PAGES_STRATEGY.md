# Comprehensive Service Pages Strategy
## Budd's Plumbing & HVAC - Cape May County, NJ

### **üéØ Strategic Overview**

Based on our SEO research and migrated content analysis, we need to create **granular, location-specific service pages** that target high-intent keywords for Cape May County's unique market.

### **üìä Current Content Analysis**

**Existing Migrated Pages:**
- `services.md` - General services overview (6 services listed)
- `tankless-water-heater.md` - Detailed service page example
- `drain-cleaning.md` - Another detailed service page

**Gap Analysis:**
‚ùå Missing emergency-focused landing pages (highest commercial intent)
‚ùå No location-specific service pages for premium markets (Stone Harbor, Avalon)
‚ùå Lack of seasonal service pages (winterization, vacation rental prep)
