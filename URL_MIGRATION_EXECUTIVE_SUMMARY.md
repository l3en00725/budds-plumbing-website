## The User's Question

> "I need to migrate from Webflow to Astro without losing Google rankings. Current Webflow has mixed URL structure (some at root like `/tankless-water-heater`, some under `/services/`). We're creating new location-specific pages. How do we handle this?"

---

## The Answer

### Keep URLs Identical = Zero SEO Risk

**DO THIS:**
```
Webflow:  /tankless-water-heater     →  Astro:  /tankless-water-heater  ✅
Webflow:  /drain-cleaning            →  Astro:  /drain-cleaning         ✅
Webflow:  /services/piping-repiping  →  Astro:  /services/piping-repiping ✅
```

**Result:** No redirects needed, rankings preserved immediately, zero re-crawl delay.

### Add New Location-Specific Pages Under /services/

**NEW PAGES (Don't exist on Webflow - zero SEO risk):**
```
/services/emergency-plumber-ocean-city-nj           ✅ NEW
/services/tankless-water-heater-stone-harbor-nj    ✅ NEW
/services/bathroom-renovation-stone-harbor-nj       ✅ NEW
[+ 14 more location-specific pages]
```

**Result:** 17 new ranking opportunities, hyper-local targeting, no cannibalization.

---

## Why This Strategy Works

### 1. URL Parity = No Google Disruption

When URLs stay identical:
- Google doesn't detect a migration
- Rankings transfer instantly (no waiting)
- Backlinks continue working immediately
- No redirect configuration needed
- Zero 301 redirect delay

### 2. Dual URL Structure = Best of Both Worlds

**General Pages (Root Level) → County-Wide:**
- `/tankless-water-heater` = Broad keyword targeting
- Targets: "tankless water heater Cape May County"
- Maintains existing authority and rankings
- Links to location-specific pages for local users

**Location-Specific Pages (/services/) → City-Level:**
- `/services/tankless-water-heater-stone-harbor-nj` = Hyper-local targeting
- Targets: "tankless water heater Stone Harbor"
- Creates NEW ranking opportunities
- Optimized for local conversion

### 3. Content Differentiation = No Cannibalization

**General Pages Focus:**
- Service overview and benefits
- County-wide coverage
- Company credentials
- General pricing

**Location-Specific Pages Focus:**
- City landmarks and neighborhoods
- Market-specific messaging (tourism, luxury, residential)
- Local response times
- City-specific FAQs

**Result:** Pages target different search intents, no keyword competition.

---

## What About the New Pages?

### NEW Location-Specific Pages = ZERO SEO Risk

You've created 17 location-specific service pages:
- 7 emergency plumber pages (different cities)
- 10 specialized service pages (premium markets)

**These are brand new content** that doesn't exist on current Webflow site.

**SEO Impact:**
- ✅ Zero risk (new pages can't hurt existing rankings)
- ✅ Growth opportunity (17 new ranking chances)
- ✅ Long-tail keyword capture (hyper-local searches)
- ✅ Featured snippet opportunities (FAQ schema)

---

## When to Use 301 Redirects

### ❌ DON'T Use Redirects When:
- URLs can stay the same (recommended)
- Creating new pages that didn't exist
- Adding location variants of existing pages

### ✅ USE Redirects ONLY When:
- URLs absolutely must change (strongly discourage)
- Consolidating duplicate pages
- Fixing broken URL structure from old site

**Current Situation:** No redirects needed if you follow recommended strategy.
