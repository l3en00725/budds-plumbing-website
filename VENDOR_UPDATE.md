# Budd's Plumbing Website - Vendor Update & Project Handoff

## Project Overview

We're building a modern, high-performance website for Budd's Plumbing, Heating & Cooling to replace the existing Webflow site at **www.buddsplumbing.com**. This document provides you with everything needed to take the project to completion.

---

## Project Goals

### Primary Objectives
1. **Speed & Performance** - Achieve Lighthouse scores >= 90 across all metrics
2. **LLM-Ready Architecture** - Optimize for AI search engines (ChatGPT, Perplexity, etc.) with proper Schema.org markup
3. **Local SEO Dominance** - Target Cape May County and surrounding South Jersey areas
4. **Conversion Optimization** - Clear CTAs, prominent phone numbers, trust badges

### Why This Matters
Modern users increasingly discover businesses through AI assistants rather than traditional search. This website is architected to be easily understood and recommended by LLMs while maintaining exceptional performance for human visitors.

- **Typography:** Space Grotesk (headings) + Inter (body)
- **Deployment Target:** Vercel
- **Repository:** https://github.com/l3en00725/budds-plumbing-website

### Why Astro?

## Design System: Positivus Theme

### Figma Design Template
**Template:** Positivus Landing Page Design
**URL:** http://figma.com/community/file/1230604708032389430/positivus-landing-page-design

This is the exact design system we're following. The template has been adapted for a service-based plumbing business while maintaining the bold, modern aesthetic of the original.

### Color Palette
- **Primary:** Black (#000000)
- **Accent:** Neon Blue (#00E5FF) - for CTAs
- **Service Cards:** Lime Green (#B9FF66)
- **Background:** White with generous whitespace

### Typography Scale
- **H1:** 2.5-4rem with tight letter-spacing
- **Body:** 1rem-1.125rem
- **Fonts:** Space Grotesk (headings), Inter (body)

### Design Principles
1. **Bold Typography** - Large, attention-grabbing headings
2. **Generous Whitespace** - 5rem section margins, 2rem grid gaps
3. **Minimalist** - Clean shadows, no heavy borders (except service cards)
4. **Conversion-Focused** - Clear CTAs, prominent phone numbers
5. **Mobile-First** - Responsive with clamp() and proper breakpoints

### Service Card Style (Positivus Cards)
- Thick black borders (1px sides, 5px bottom for depth effect)
- 24px rounded corners
- Circular arrow buttons with hover animations
- Real photos (not illustrations)
- Hover effects: lift + shadow

**Important:** All new pages should strictly follow the Positivus design system from the Figma template. Consistency across the site is critical for brand recognition and user experience.

   ↓
2. Research Expert analyzes local search data
   → Returns: "Ocean City plumber", "emergency plumbing Ocean City" (high search volume)
   ↓
3. Web Dev Expert Agent receives research data
   → Generates: Astro page with Positivus design, local Schema markup, optimized content
   ↓
4. Optimization Expert reviews generated code
   → Checks: Image sizes, font loading, CSS optimization
   → Returns: Performance recommendations
   ↓
5. Web Dev Expert implements optimizations
